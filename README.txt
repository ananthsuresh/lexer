To compile the code, either use an IDE or use javac from the command line to compile each Java file in the lexer folder. None of the classes have a main method, so you cannot run the programs. However, there is a JUnit program named TokenTester.java that you can run to run the tests. I would recommend running the JUnit Tests using an IDE, but you can also run it from the command line as long as you have added the JUnit jar file to your classpath.
